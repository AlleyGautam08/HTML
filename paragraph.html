     <p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
          The HTML element defines a paragraph.A paragraph always starts on a new line, 
          and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
          You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
          Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
          With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML
          The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
     </p>
     <hr>
     <p>
          The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window, 
          the number of lines in this paragraph will change.
